High Growth Handbook is the playbook for growing your startup into a global brand.

"If you want the chance to turn your startup into the next Google or Twitter, then read this trenchant guide from someone who played key roles in the growth of these companies."

--Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn and New York Times #1 bestselling author

Learn everything there is to know about the new secure runtime for JavaScript: Deno. A proposed replacement for Node.js envisioned and created by the same developer who wrote the first version of Node, Deno is a simple, modern and secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that uses V8 and is built in Rust. This book will cover everything from its inception to the currently available version.

You’ll see how to take advantage of the security layer in order to avoid unwanted security holes, and how to use TypeScript to develop your applications without having to manually set up a build process. You’ll also learn how to create and use modules without having to depend on a package manager, and much more. Armed with these newly learned concepts, by the time you finish this book, you’ll be ready to build and test your own Deno applications.

Whether you’re a brand new developer to the back end with a JavaScript background or a seasoned Node.js developer looking to understand this competing technology, _Introducing Deno_ will put you on the right path.

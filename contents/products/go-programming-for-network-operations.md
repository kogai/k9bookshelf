This book illustrates how to apply Go programming to network operations. The topics cover common use cases through examples that are designed to act as a guide and serve as a reference. The reader is assumed to have already gained a fundamental understanding of Go programming; however, the examples are explained for additional clarification. The focus is on using Go for network operations, not on the language itself.
